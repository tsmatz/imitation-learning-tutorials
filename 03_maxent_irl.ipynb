    "\n",
    "> Note : We will discuss IRL with nonlinear rewards in [GAIL example](./05_gail.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assumption, the idea of feature expectation matching finds the optimal policy $\\pi^L$ in the training, which satisfies :\n",
    "\n",

    "To obtain the solution, [[Ratliff et al., 2006](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3154-boosting-structured-prediction-for-imitation-learning)] has proposed **Maximum-Margin Planning (MMP)** method, which method is to find a cost function to maximize the difference between the optimal policy and others.<br>\n",

    "Now let's briefly follow this method along with the original paper [[Brian et al., 2008](https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-227.pdf)].\n",

    "\n",
    "I note that Lagrangian multiplier $\\theta$ becomes a reward weight, and the policy will then be given by using $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above equation is trajectory view of equation, but now let's switch to the state-action's view.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it's finite time horizon, the feature of trajectory $\\phi(\\tau)$ is the sum of state's features, i.e $\\phi(\\tau) = \\sum_{s_i \\in \\tau} \\phi(s_i)$. (Because $\\verb|[reward of trajectory|\\;\\tau\\verb|]| = \\sum_{s_i \\in \\tau} \\verb|[reward of state|\\;s_i\\verb|]|$ in feature expectation.)<br>\n",
    "Then it can be written by :\n",

    "> If it's infinite time horizon, apply the discounted reward's weights for features. (In this example, I use reward's weights without discount.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\sum_{\\tau} p(\\tau) = 1$, this then leads to the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
